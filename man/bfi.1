.Sh DESCRIPTION
Brainfuck is an esotheric programming language based on minimalism,
invented by 
.Ar Urban MÃ¼ller 
in 1993.
.Pp
bfi executes brainfuck programs in a sicure environment.
.Pp
bfi support several working mode:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Sy  "standard"
execute  given script and exit.
.Pp
.It Sy  "debug   "
perform debug operation on given script
.Pp 
.It Sy  "interactive"
execute code given from command line 
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Fl "d"
run debug mode
.Pp
.It Fl "D"
run waiting debug mode
.Pp
.It Fl "i"
run interactive mode
.Pp
.It Fl "e" Ar command
excute Brainfuck program give with command
.Pp
.It Fl "r" Ar filename 
read input from 
.Ar filename
instead of 
.Ar stdin
(
.Ar filename
must exist
)
.Pp   
.It Fl "w" Ar filename 
write output to 
.Ar filename
instead of 
.Ar stdout
(
.Ar filename
must not exist
)
.Pp
.It Fl "R" Ar filename
open
.Ar filename
in inplace mode:
read input from and write output to
.Ar filename
(
.Ar filename
must exist
)
.Pp   
.It Fl "I"
ignore  arguments given to brainfuck program
.Pp
.It Fl "W"
enable executable and code warnings
.Pp
.It Fl "h"
show a brief help message and exit
.Pp

.Sh PROGRAMMING INTERFACE

Note for brainfuck programmers using bfi:

.Ss Debug Mode:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
Debug command : '?', put it into che code when you  need to debug
(with -d or -D option set)
.Pp
every  ? into the code enable debug mode, showing the following 
information:
.Pp
.It "Current Memory Value"
Shows value stored into the current memory location in 
decimal and hexadecimal notation
.It "Current Memory Location"
Shows the memory location, relative to the head of the
array
.It "Debug Call Count"
Shows the count of Debug Call so far.
.Pp
.El

If debug mode is enable with D option(waiting debug)
after each message program 
execution stops and wait for user pressing return,
otherwise program execution proceeds without pauses.
    
    
.Ss Command Line Arguments:
    command line arguments are put inside the main buffer:
    the first argument is copied in the first location,the second is 
    separated by a zero from the first and so on.
    two consecutive zero represents the end of arguments.
    

.Ss EXIT VALUE
Normally the exit value is 0,
but if an error the possible exit values are:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It "1:"
given 
.Ar program_file
does not exists
.It "2:"
given
.Ar filename
is not a regular file
.It "3:"
unable to open 
.Ar filename
.It "4:"
unable to allocate memory
.It "5:"
unable to set the execution environment
.It "6:"
brainfuck program exit from available memory
.It "7:"
given 
.Ar file
/
.Ar command
does not contain brainfuck code
.It "8:"
given 
.Ar program_file
/
.Ar command
contains at least a not closed jump
.It "9:"
given 
.Ar program_file
/
.Ar command
contains at least a not opened jump
.It "10:"
output file already exists
.El
    
.Sh INTERACTIVE CONSOLE
A input_command is everything between the first character and the first
space in the input string,the rest is input_command's argument.
If there aren't spaces the command is the all input string.
.Pp
Here are listed the available command for the interactive shell:
every input_command not matching them exactly is consider as Brainfuck code, and parsed
as one big block(no distinction between command and arguments)
underlined arguments are mandatory
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It "Run" Ar filename Op argument
execute given file.
The argument for the called program can be only one,
argument is not split there's a space inside it.
.It "cl"
clear many buffer and  reset memory location
.It "help"
show a brief help message
.It "cd" Ar dirname 
change working directory to 
.Ar dirname
,the path can be relative or absolute.
~ is consider as $HOME,only if it is the first character.
.It "pwd"
prints current working directory
.It "ls"
list directory contents,showing hidden files.
directory are printed blue, files regular color
and .bf file(supposed to be brainfuck programs) are printed purple
.It "exit"
close the program.
.El
